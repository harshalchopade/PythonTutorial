#Decorators are a very powerful and useful tool in Python since it allows programmers to modify
# the behaviour of function or class. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend
# the behaviour of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.
# But before diving deep into decorators let us understand some concepts that will come in
# handy in learning the decorators.


#First Class Objects
#In Python, functions are first class objects that mean that functions in Python can be used or passed as arguments.

##Properties of first class functions:

#A function is an instance of the Object type.
#You can store the function in a variable.
#You can pass the function as a parameter to another function.
#You can return the function from a function.
#You can store them in data structures such as hash tables, lists, …

#Example 1: Treating the functions as objects.
# Python program to illustrate functions
# can be treated as objects
def shout(text):
    return text.upper()

print(shout('Hello'))
yell = shout
print(yell('Hello'))

#In the above example, we have assigned the function shout to a variable.
# This will not call the function instead it takes the function object referenced by a shout and
# creates a second name pointing to it, yell.

#Example 2: Passing the function as an argument
# Python program to illustrate functions
# can be passed as arguments to other functions
def shout(text):
	return text.upper()

def whisper(text):
	return text.lower()

def greet(func):
	# storing the function in a variable
	greeting = func("""Hi, I am created by a function passed as an argument.""")
	print (greeting)

greet(shout)
greet(whisper)

#In the above example, the greet function takes another function as a parameter (shout and whisper in this case).
# The function passed as an argument is then called inside the function greet.

#Example 3: Returning functions from another functions.
# Python program to illustrate functions
# Functions can return another function

def create_adder(x):
	def adder(y):
		return x+y

	return adder

add_15 = create_adder(15)

print(add_15(10))

#In the above example, we have created a function inside of another function and then have returned the
# function created inside.
#The above three examples depict the important concepts that are needed to understand decorators.
# After going through them let us now dive deep into decorators.
