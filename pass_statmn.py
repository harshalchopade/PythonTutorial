#The pass statement is a null statement. But the difference between pass and comment is that comment
# is ignored by the interpreter whereas pass is not ignored.

#The pass statement is generally used as a placeholder i.e. when the user does not know what code to write.
# So user simply places pass at that line. Sometimes, pass is used when the user doesn’t want any code to execute.
# So user can simply place pass where empty code is not allowed, like in loops, function definitions, class definitions,
# or in if statements. So using pass statement user avoids this error.

for i in range(1,100):
    if (i%2!=0):
        pass
    else:
        print(i)

print("Bye")

#Example 1: Pass statement can be used in empty functions

def geekFunction():
  pass

#Example 2: pass statement can also be used in empty class

class geekClass:
    pass

# Example 3: pass statement can be used in for loop when user doesn’t know what to code inside the loop
n = 10
for i in range(n):
    # pass can be used as placeholder
    # when code is to added later
    pass

#Example 4: pass statement can be used with conditional statements
a = 10
b = 20

if (a < b):
    pass
else:
    print("b<a")


#Example 5: lets take another example in which the pass statement get executed when the condition is true

li = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

for i in li:
    if (i == 'a'):
        pass
    else:
        print(i)
