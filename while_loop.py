#If we want some statments needs to be repeated multiple times
#To do that we use loops
#while loop
#It can be used when we have certain iterations and for certain conditions

#Prerequiste
#initialize the variable.
#add the condition.
#increment/decrement the variable.

#i = 1
#while i<5:
#    print("Python")
#    i=i+1

#Nested while
#Note - Also when we need the cursor to be on the same line for printing use (end ="") in print statment.
#print() use to move to the next line
